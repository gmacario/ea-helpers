genivi-uml-helpers
==================

This project contains a small set of scripts which can make your life with
[Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect][1] UML Modeling Tool easier.

I ([Gianpaolo Macario][2]) developed those scripts to streamline
my daily work as System Architect within the [GENIVI Alliance][3].

The scripts are released under the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0 - 
see file `LICENSE` in the code for details.
